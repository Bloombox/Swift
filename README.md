# Bloombox for Swift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bloombox/Swift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Bloombox/Swift) [![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/726f360df7dbf653931f/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Bloombox/Swift/maintainability)

Latest Version: `0.0.9`

This Swift package provides an API client for [Bloombox](https://bloombox.io) Cloud APIs. Bloombox APIs are built and served using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) and exposed in client libraries like this one with a more fluid interface to work with.

That being said, you can always opt to use the lower level gRPC APIs, either via gRPC+protobuf (docs coming soon) or via JSON REST, using transcoding (docs coming soon on this too).

In terms of iOS land, this library client is built in native Swift, and packaged as a Cocoapod and Swift Package. It is built on [Apple's Protobuf for Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf) and the new native [gRPC for Swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift). It is tested on macOS 11, and iOS 11, although the underlying tools are still under active development, and so YMMV.


### Using the code

Published libs coming soon. In the meantime, see `Building the code`.


### Building the code

Building the code is easy and follows standard Swift packaging conventions. There is also a `Makefile` packaged with various useful routines - you'll use `make` if you are developing on the code.

**Required tools:**
- XCode/Swift 9
- `make` and other CLI tools for XCode
- Code access to private schema repos for Bloombox


## Services


### Shop API

The Shop API allows interaction with ordering, user enrollment and verification, and other tools. Demo code coming soon.


### Telemetry API

The Telemetry API allows you to relay events as they happen, so they may be attributed in user flows and other Bloombox-provided metrics.
